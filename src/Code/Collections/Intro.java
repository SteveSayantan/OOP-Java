        The only advantage with array is that we can use multiple values using a single variable, hence code readability improves.

        Problems with Arrays:
        ---------------------

        1. Fixed in size. Once it is created, the size can not be modified acc. to our requirement. We need to know the size beforehand.

        2. Arrays can only hold homogeneous datatype of elements. However, this issue can be solved using Object-type array.

        3. Array is not implemented based on some standard data structure. It is only a memory-level concept. As a result, readymade
            method support is not available. For every requirement, the programmer has to write code explicitly. Increases the complexity of code.

            
        To overcome above problems of arrays, we use Collections concept.
        
        1. Collections are growable in nature, i.e. based on our requirement, we can modify (increase and decrease) its size.
        
        2. Collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous objects.
        
        3. Every collection class is based on some standard data structure. Hence, for every requirement, readymade method support is available.

        Arrays are more performant than Collections. But in terms of memory usage, Collections are better as their size can be changed accordingly.

        Arrays can hold both primitives and objects. But collections can only hold objects.

        # What is Collection?
         If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity, we use collections.

        # What is Collection Framework?
         It contains several classes and interfaces used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.
