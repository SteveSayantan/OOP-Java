         Collection
        ============
        - If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity, we use collections. 

        - Collection interface defines the most common methods applicable for any collection object.

        Methods:
        ---------
        - boolean add (Object o) : adds the given object to the collection.
        - boolean addAll (Collection c) : adds a group of objects to the collection.
        - boolean remove (Object o) : removes the particular object from the collection.
        - boolean removeAll (Collection c) : removes a group of objects from the collection.
        - void clear() : removes all objects from the collection.
        - boolean retainAll (Collection c) : removes all objects except a particular group from the collection.
        - boolean contains (Object o): checks if an object is available.
        - boolean containsAll (Collection c): checks if a group of objects is available.
        - boolean isEmpty()
        - int size()
        - Object[] toArray() : converts the collection into an array of Objects and returns it.
        - Iterator iterator(): returns an Interator object.

        # There is no concrete class that implements Collection interface directly
