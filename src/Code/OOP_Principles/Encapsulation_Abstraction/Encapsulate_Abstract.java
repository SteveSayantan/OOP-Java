    Encapsulation:
    --------------
        It refers to the process of wrapping up the implementation of the data members and methods in a class. It talks about security.

    Abstraction:
    ------------
        Hiding unnecessary details and only sharing valuable information. Users can use the methods available to
        get their job done.  

    Example:
    --------
        When designing a software, the designers will decide which methods should be there for users. This is
        called abstraction.  

        Now, to achieve this, the developers have to create some class, methods etc. Therefore, the
        writing of the code (to be protected from outside world ) is encapsulation and this creates abstraction.  
    
    Data Hiding:
    ------------
        Keeping data hidden (using private) to that it can not be accessed directly.

        Now, using getters, setters to modify those data can be termed as encapsulation.

        Data hiding is achieved via Encapsulation, hence Encapsulation is a subprocess of Data Hiding.
